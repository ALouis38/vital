VITAL Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to VITAL which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.

Removed boost libraries as dependencies. The vital libraries no longer
require boost to build. Requiring boost was problematic because it was
difficult to build a sufficient version on all the platforms we
support.

Replaced boost supplied features with those from std and kwiversys OS
Abstraction Layer. Using the std boost equivalent features required
compiling with C++ 0x standard support. The CMake build system now
tests for required compiler flags.

Test vital builds on CentOS 5, OSX, Windows. Due to the later c++
standard requirements, VS 2013 is the build system being supported.

Add method to algorithm plugin manager to load plugins on the first
call.  This is used by sprokit processes to optimize plugin
loading. Previously, each process would (re)load all plugins. This new
method reduces startup time considerably.

More compiler warning flags have been added to catch programming
errors and questionable practices. Code has been modified to compile
without warnings. Missing libraries were added to CMake files.

Added build time checks to determine which language features are
available with the current compiler. More advanced language features
are used in place of older work-arounds, such as range based for in
place of more complicated FOREACH macros.

Improved documentation and added examples in the documentation.

Vital now installs a standard set of CMake support functions and
macros intended to simplify and unify building packages that depend on vital.

Standardized install directory structure so that vital, maptk and
sprokit can all install into the same install-root directory.

Modified the approach to handling custom data types in the
config. Since the internal config structure holds values as strings,
the conversion to and from the c++ type has been simplified and
documented.  This conversion is done with two user supplied templated
specializations of the default conversion functions.

Added support for config entry attributes. Currently supporting the
read-only "[RO]" attribute borrowed from sprokit config semantics.

Refactored camera related data types by moving code between Map-TK and
vital.

The C bindings used for the python interface have been converted to
vital namespace, are built and tested.

Reworked timestamp class to contain integral number of micro-seconds
and changed access methods to specify units returned.

Added logging support to algorithm base classes to simplify liogging
in the derived classes. Also added logging support to some of the
vital types.
