VITAL Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to VITAL which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.

Changes since last public release
---------------------------------

 - Added abstract and templated types for fundamental matrix.

 - Added abstract algorithm for fundamental matrix estimation.

 - Added RGB color to the landmark data type

 - Generalized landmark I/O (.ply file format) to read and write additional
   fields, including RGB color.

- Cleaned up code so it is compatible with all supported platforms.

- Consolidated CMake support for Map-TK building. Moved required features to
  vital cmake support so Map-TK can use more of the vital CMake support.

- Fixed problem where kwiversys library is build and installed into the correct
  lib directory. The build and install locations were not compatible preventing
  client packages from finding kwiversys library in the build directory.

- Added initial support for packaging of vital libraries and associated files.

- Fixed problem with formatting time stamp in log messages. One windows VS version
  did not support the initial implementation.

- Cleaned up source code by removing unused variables and features.

- Added feature to CMake plugin building to collect list of plugins built. This is
  used when installing to determine which modules have been built.

- Added a set of functions to provide multiple architecture support for determining
  the directory where the current executable resides. This is used by client packages
  to assist in locating plugins and libraries.

- Addressed several minor problems that caused build warnings on windows builds.

- Simplified some looping constructs by replacing for() loop with VITAL_FOREACH()


Other branches
--------------

dev/add-plugin-manager - Initial thoughts on adapting vidtk plugin
                         manager for loading vital plugins. This is a
                         work in progress and is not conceptually
                         complete.

kw/add-klv-toolkit - Initial thoughts on porting KLV library from
                     vidtk. It is part of the effort to make a video
                     input process. The KLV parser may be complete,
                     but the video input process is not finished.
